# omnibox
Attempt to capture several different pieces of related information about a subject in one typeahed-assisted-tags-list-box without enforcing any order to the input.

The intention is to provide a single component that can recognise different types of data, match them to expected formats, and intelligently make completion suggetsions to the "active input" based on the tags already captured.
